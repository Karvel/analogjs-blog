My name is Elanna. I have been a full-stack developer for over seven years, primarily focused on Angular and .NET. I have a BA in Linguistics from UCSC and made my way into the software industry after first taking computer science community college courses and then joining a paid internship in 2016. I have been delving into Angular since 2017, ever since writing the first line of code for my then employerâ€™s product front-end overhaul. I now work for [Crexi](https://www.crexi.com/) as a front end lead software engineer. I enjoy mentoring in code and helping dismantle some of the built-in barriers found in the coding world. I was also on the non-profit [59DaysOfCode](https://59daysofcode.org) Grand Council for a two year term.
