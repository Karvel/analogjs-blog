## About Me

My name is Elanna. I have been a full-stack developer for over seven years, primarily focused on Angular and .NET. I have a BA in Linguistics from UCSC and made my way into the software industry after first taking computer science community college courses and then joining a paid internship in 2016. I have been delving into Angular since 2017, ever since writing the first line of code for my then employerâ€™s product front-end overhaul. I most recently worked for <a href="https://www.crexi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crexi</a> as a front end lead software engineer. I enjoy mentoring in code and helping dismantle some of the built-in barriers found in the coding world. I was also on the non-profit <a href="https://59daysofcode.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">59DaysOfCode</a> Grand Council for a two year term.

For fun I like to dabble in photography, eat the hottest food I can get away with, and travel. Please contact me with any questions or comments.

## About The Site

In 2023, I decided to rebuild my blog in <a href="https://analogjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Analog</a>, moving away from Wordpress. I am already familiar with Angular, and Analog provides some niceties like markdown rendering, SSG, file-based routing, and XML generation for the sitemap and RSS.
