I overhauled the website after being convinced by a friend that it was long overdue. I am still using a prebuilt theme but I put a lot more work into customizing it and playing around with php underneath. I am still tweaking things, looking at whether I should add anymore plugins (testing one that pulls photos from my flickr to post), and considering adding some flashy scripting, but now that it is off the ground, I am going to turn my attention over to my equally deprived GitHub and start uploading some school projects as repositories. To new beginnings!
