[GDG Fresno](http://www.gdgfresno.com/) accepted my talk proposal for [Valley DevFest](https://valleydevfest.com/)! It is titled [Observables Are Not Promises! A How To](https://valleydevfest.com/sessions/-LNGtb_br0M5E9_8rVWT). The talk will be on October 20, 2018 at 11:00 AM at Bitwise South Stadium in Fresno. I still have some work to do on the talk, and I needed to dust off and update this portfolio.

Here is the talk description:

An exploration of observables, the headlining feature of RxJS and primary asynchronous structure in Angular. We will look at common use cases and pitfalls, both client and server-side, and discuss how to move away from promise-based data flow.

The GitHub repo for the Angular client is [here](https://github.com/Karvel/angular-observable-examples-app). The API repo is [here](https://github.com/Karvel/angular-observables-api). The link to the slide deck is [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vothDZHzTdMA1mM6F2R2XMGWpgZqlUOcmNE74edf_1Y).
