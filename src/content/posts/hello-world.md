I decided it was time to finally get some web space again and actually do something with it this time. I went with Lithium Hosting and it has been a very easy setup so far. I plan on trying out WordPress to start, so I can get experience with it even if I end up switching to another CMS later.

I think this will just be a link to some of my other, more dedicated sites. I don’t personally need to reinvent the wheel by hosting my own repositories or image archives, although I might add dedicated pages for specific programs if it makes sense later.
