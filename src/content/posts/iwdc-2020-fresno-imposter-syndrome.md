I gave another talk! This time it was at IWDC Fresno 2020. The talk is titled Imposter Syndrome: No One Belongs Here More Than You!, and the content is available [here](https://github.com/Karvel/iwdc-2020-imposter-syndrome-talk).

It has been over two years since I gave my [last talk](https://hapax-legomenon.net/2018/10/valley-devfest-observables-talk/) at a conference.
